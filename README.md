# istAssessmentWebsite

This was an assessment task for the subject Information Software Technology in 2019. The task was to utilise HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a visually appealing
website containing content describing the internet and its development. The marking criteria centered around the design and functionality of the website rather then
the content.
